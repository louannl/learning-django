## The Basics
### URLS

urls.py had a list of paths: urlpatterns, which we can edit and add functions to: 

def project(request, pk):
    return HttpResponse('SINGLE PROJECT' + ' ' + str(pk))


urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('projects/', projects, name="projects"),
    path('project/<str:pk>/', project, name="project"),
]

To make this tidier: 
- Add the functions to the views.py file in our projects folder
- Add a urls.py file to projects, which imports those functions and setups a 
  url pattern. 
- Then add the include function to the urls.py in devsearch to dynamically 
  include those patterns.
